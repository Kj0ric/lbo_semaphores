// How good from previous non-sol? What is problematic? 
Now, only one thread can enter the if block and decrement the turnstile. However, that thread should not sleep
while holding the mutex. Unfortunately it can happen! ???????

This code allows a precocious thread to pass through the second mutex, then loop around and pass through the first 
mutex and the turnstile, effectively getting ahead of the other threads by a lap. Imagine this case:
