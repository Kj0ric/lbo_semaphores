// Another bad solution: If reading count outside atomic section is problematic why not put it inside?

rendezvous
mutex.wait()
    count = count + 1
    if count == n: barrier.signal()
    barrier.wait()
    barrier.signal()
mutex.signal()
critical point

// Why is it bad?
Deadlock again. 
Imagine a thread acquiring the mutex and incrementing the counter, then sleeping WHILE HOLDING THE MUTEX!
No other threads would be able to go into the critical section and do anything.
